# Zombie Arcade Game

A Zombie Arcade game made by Sam Silver and Will Bowie. All art and music was made by Will Bowie. Scripts and Sound effects were made by Sam Silver.

The first Version of the game can be found in the releases section!

I am currently working on porting this game to the web with improved features, such as a highscore screen. Read "Change of Engines" for more details.

## Change of Engines

I wanted to try different engines to learn what is avabliable in the game development world. I started to re-create this project in the following engines:
- Godot 4.0
- Phaser 3
- PixiJS

Each implementation can be found in different branchs. The main being the godot 4.0 branch.

I am now manily focusing on the PixiJS framework with some of my own implementations to create an "engine" for this game. This branch can be found at "pixijs-version".

I hope to release this version on the web in the next couple of months.
