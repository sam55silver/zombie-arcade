# zombie-arcade

A Zombie Arcade game made by Sam Silver and Will Bowie. All art and music was made by Will Bowie. Scripts and Sound effects were made by Sam Silver.

## Tragedy

Sadly, the scripts and sound effects have been corrupted during a transfer of data to different work stations.
Hopefully, I will be able to re-create this game to finish it. For now, version 4.0 is around and playable. There is only a missing story feature and a couple of bugs.

## Change of engines

Originally my plan was to re-create the game in phaser3, however, godot recently released a new build for 4.0 which has gotten me very excited. Opening up and messing around I was able to re-create most of the game within a couple of hours. full steam ahead with godot!
