# zombie-arcade

A Zombie Arcade game made by Sam Silver and Will Bowie. All art and music was made by Will Bowie. Scripts and Sound effects were made by Sam Silver.

## Tragedy

Sadly, the scripts and sound effects have been corrupted during a transfer of data to different work stations.
Hopefully, I will be able to re-create this game to finish it. For now, version 4.0 is around and playable. There is only a missing story feature and a couple of bugs.

## Change of engines

This branch is for phaser3 implementation, mostly wanted to see how developing a game in phaser would be like. It isn't as intuitive as godot but I can see it being very customizable and powerful.
