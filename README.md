# Zombie Arcade Game

A Zombie Arcade game made by Sam Silver and Will Bowie. All art and music was made by Will Bowie. Scripts and Sound effects were made by Sam Silver.

## Tragedy

Sadly, the scripts and sound effects have been corrupted during a transfer of data to different work stations.
Hopefully, I will be able to re-create this game to finish it. For now, version 4.0 is around and playable. There is only a missing story feature and a couple of bugs.

## Change of engines

I wanted to try different engines to learn what is avabliable in the game development world. I started to re-create this project in the following engines:
- Godot 4.0
- Phaser 3
- PixiJS

Each implementation can be found in different branchs. The master being the godot 4.0 branch.

I am now manily focusing on the PixiJS framework with some of my own implementations to create an "engine" for this game. This branch can be found at "pixijs-version".

I hope to release this version on the web in the next couple of months.
